```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Task 3
Create an HTML document that samples 100 values from a log-normal
distribution (say, mu=1, sigma=.25). Create a histogram of the distribution and
the distribution on the log scale; report the mean and variance of the sample in
line in the text.

We sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution (mean equals 1, variance equals 0.125) using the built in R function rlnrom.

```{r sampling and histograms}
sample = rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)

logsample = log(sample)
```
We plot the results of this sampling process in two histograms using the built in hist function of R.
```{r}
hist(sample)
hist(logsample)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
